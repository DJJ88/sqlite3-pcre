This is sqlite3-pcre, an extension for sqlite3 that uses libpcre to provide
the REGEXP() function.

The code was written by Alexey Tourbin and the original can be found at:

This version was created by Roger Light. It contains no code changes but a
tweaked build script to make it easier to package.
